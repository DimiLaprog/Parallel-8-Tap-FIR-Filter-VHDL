# Parallel-8-Tap-FIR-Filter-VHDL
2 INPUT/OUTPUT Parallel 8 Tap FIR Filter written in VHDL , compiled, simulated and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado.

Implementation was done following a "structural" methodology and using behavioral VHDL. More specifically the modules constructed were:

1. Input Module




## Below it is presented in the following order:
1. Circuit Design using pipeline where red lines and dots indicate the positions of extra flip flops to be used in order to achieve pipeline.
2. RTL produced by Vivado
3. Behavioral Simulation
> Note that pipeline produces correct results after 11 Clock Cycles and initial reg values are 0.
